I'm a Bristol based software engineer currently working at [Ghyston](https://www.ghyston.com/). You can find me on:

* [Github](https://github.com/mattmarch>Github)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-march-a75b21121/)
* [Email](mailto:me@mattmarch.co.uk)

Here's some of the projects I've been working on recently:

* [Birthday Playlist Generator](https://playlist.mattmarch.co.uk), automatically a Spotify playlist of UK number one singles on your past Birthdays. Check out my [write up of this project here](/birthday-playlist).
* [RGB Pigs](https://mattmarch.itch.io/rgb-pigs), a topdown survival game where you must toggle your flashlight's colour to tell friend from foe. Playable in browser and built with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
* Creating _this_ website Gatsby and Typescript, check out my [short write up of why and how here](/new-website).
