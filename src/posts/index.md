I'm a Bristol based software engineer currently working at [Ghyston](https://www.ghyston.com/). You can find me on:

* [Github](https://github.com/mattmarch>Github)

* [Email](mailto:me@mattmarch.co.uk)

I've just recreated my website using Gatsby and Typescript, check out my [short write up of why and how here](/new-website).

Hopefully I'll have more content coming soon!
