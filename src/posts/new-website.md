You're reading this on the new and updated version of my website. I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) built and hosted for free by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I love starting personal projects. Unfortunately much more than finishing them. The motivation behind this website is to have somewhere to build a portfolio and force myself to put the final polish on projects to get them into a state to show off.

Previously, this site used [Github pages and Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll). I'm a fan of the idea of using Markdown to statically generate blog like pages, but unfortunately not really a fan of any of the default themes. Of course, the themes are completely customisable/overridable but making seemingly small tweaks always seems to be more painful than it should be.

After seeing friends making websites with Gatsby and Netlify I thought I'd give it a go. I'm much more comfortable with React compared to Ruby so it seemed like a sensible choice.

By default Netlify created a [gatsby-blog-starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) repo for me but I scrapped this after I ran through the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/). In this you start from scratch (well, the hello world template) and build a "Pandas Eating Lots" blog. This was straightforward enough that I thought this seemed a lot more fun than trying to customise the existing blog template.

Starting from the [hello world starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world) I:

- Added typescript by following [a couple](https://medium.com/@whoisryosuke/adding-typescript-to-gatsby-c4a8cdcb0e7e) of [medium articles](https://medium.com/maxime-heckel/getting-started-with-typescript-on-gatsby-8544b47c1d27). I figured it'd be easier to add it early on, and if I want to do anything more complex with this site in the future type safety will be useful!
- Added [Typography.js](https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/) to make everything look pretty without having to do too much CSS.
- Created a page header using the best recent photo that I'd taken (on a COVID-19 daily quarantine exercise walk to the Clifton Suspension Bridge).
- Followed the example of the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) to generate pages from Markdown.

And that's it!

All that's left to do is for me to keep updating with content!
