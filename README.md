  My Gatsby Site
</h1>

My personal website, built by me in Gatsby and Typescript from the [hello-world-starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world).

I've written a short post on how and why I built this site, so check it out [here](https://mattmarch.co.uk/new-website/)!

## Developing

In the project directory:
```
  gatsby develop
```
...and check it out on `http://localhost:8000/`

It is automatically built and deployed by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) on push to master.
